Our previous architecure models where updated as well <br>
A table of which use cases were implemented in each milestone <br>
Lastly, a software architecture was created including 3 unique views and an interface document

# Milestone 3

In this milestone, we used 4 different design patterns to be included in our web application design, namely: Decorator, Chain of Responsibility, Command and Facade. <br>
We created a class diagram for all object-oriented implementation modules for our web application. <br>
We also created an object-diagram to show the instances at the run-time.

# Milestone 2

In this milestone we created five new types of diagrams, namely: Sequence Diagrams, Communication Diagrams, State Machine Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, and Timing Diagrams.<br>
We updated our previous diagrams from milestone 2 based on our iterative design process <br>
We also began development on a rapid prototype.
